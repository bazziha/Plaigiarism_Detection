#Plaigiarism Detection Project

This project demonstrates the ability to use support vector machine to detect whether a source text is plaigiarized or not. We utilize machine learning support vector machine and other text processing algorithms such as ngrams and longest common subsequence algorithms to train/deploy the model and engineer our features respectively.
